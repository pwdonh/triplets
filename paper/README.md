The commands to run the analyses from the paper are given in the [Makefile](Makefile), you can also run the individual parts as: 
```
make model_comparison
make model_exploration
make model_comparison_updated
```
The model comparisons will take a long time to run. You can plot the results from precomputed models, that are part of this repository, as:
```
python plot_results.py
```
