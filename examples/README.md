# Example notebooks

- [example_1_simulate_data.ipynb](example_1_simulate_data.ipynb) shows how to simulate an odd-one-out dataset from a ground-truth model and explains the format with which the data are stored.
- [example_2_fit_choice_model.ipynb](example_2_fit_choice_model.ipynb) shows how to fit a model to this data to reconstruct the features underlying the odd-one-out choices and how they are weighted by different raters.
